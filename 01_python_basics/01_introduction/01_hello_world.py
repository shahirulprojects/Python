# welcome to python! this is your first python program :)

# python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that's great for beginners
# these lines starting with '#' are comments - python ignores them when running the code
# we use comments to explain what our code does

# printing text to the screen
print("Hello, World!")  # this is the traditional first program in any language

# we can print multiple lines
print("Welcome to Python!")
print("Let's learn programming together!")

# we can also use triple quotes for multi-line strings
print("""
This is a multi-line
string that will print
exactly as formatted here
""")

# quick note about python versions:
# we're using python 3.x, which is the current modern version
# python 2.x is outdated and should not be used for new projects

# try it yourself:
# 1. change the text inside the print statements
# 2. add your own print statement
# 3. try using both single quotes ('') and double quotes ("")

# practice exercise:
# write code below to print your name and why you're learning python
# example:
print("My name is [your name]")
print("I'm learning Python because [your reason]")
