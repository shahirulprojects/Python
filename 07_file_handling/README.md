## learning path

### 1. basic file operations (start here)

- understanding file paths and directories
- opening and closing files properly
- basic read and write operations
- file modes and permissions
- error handling in file operations

### 2. reading and writing techniques

- text file manipulation
- buffered I/O for better performance
- asynchronous file operations
- memory-mapped files for large datasets

### 3. working with file formats

- CSV for tabular data
- JSON for structured data
- binary files for raw data
- XML for markup data
- YAML for configuration

### 4. advanced operations

- file compression and archiving
- secure file handling
- encryption and decryption
- large file processing
- temporary files

## best practices

1. **resource management**

   - always use context managers (with statements)
   - properly close file handles
   - handle resources efficiently

2. **error handling**

   - implement proper exception handling
   - validate file operations
   - check file existence and permissions

3. **performance optimization**

   - use appropriate buffer sizes
   - implement streaming for large files
   - optimize memory usage

4. **security considerations**
   - validate file paths
   - handle sensitive data securely
   - implement proper permissions

## practical examples

each section includes hands-on examples:

1. **file operations**

   ```python
   # safe file reading using context manager
   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
       content = file.read()
   ```

2. **error handling**

   ```python
   try:
       with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
           content = file.read()
   except FileNotFoundError:
       print("file doesn't exist")
   except PermissionError:
       print("permission denied")
   ```

3. **working with paths**

   ```python
   from pathlib import Path

   # create platform-independent path
   data_file = Path('data') / 'example.txt'
   if data_file.exists():
       print(f"file size: {data_file.stat().st_size} bytes")
   ```

## common pitfalls to avoid

1. **resource leaks**

   - not closing files properly
   - leaving file handles open in error cases

2. **path handling**

   - using hardcoded path separators
   - not handling path encoding

3. **memory issues**

   - reading large files entirely into memory
   - not using appropriate buffering

4. **security risks**
   - not validating file paths
   - unsafe file permissions
   - unsecured sensitive data

## exercises and projects

1. **basic operations**

   - create a file manager utility
   - implement a log file handler
   - build a file backup system

2. **format handling**

   - create a CSV to JSON converter
   - build a configuration file parser
   - implement a file format validator

3. **advanced implementations**
   - build a file encryption tool
   - create a compression utility
   - implement a file monitoring system
